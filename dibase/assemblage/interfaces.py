class DigestCacheBase(metaclass=ABCMeta):
  '''
  Digest caches are intended to cache digests of elements' associated resources.
  It is expected that practical implementations will work in conjunction with
  some sort of persistent digest store from which element digests can be loaded
  and updated digests written back. The write back cache pattern was chosen as
  it is likely that if action steps to create a resource fail then it may not
  be appropriate to write back updated resource digests that triggered the
  action steps. It also allows grouping of update writes so may allow for
  better performance in some storage implementations.
  '''
  @abstractmethod
  def updateIfDifferent(self, element):
    '''
    The element parameter is assumed to adhere to the ElementBase interface.
    If the element.digest() value differs from the cached value (or stored
    value if not yet cached) then the cached value is updated and marked as
    dirty (i.e. will be written back by the cache writeBack method) and True
    is returned. Otherwise, the digests compare equal and False is returned.
    Digest values should be associated with the str value of the element
    parameter.
    '''
    pass
  @abstractmethod
  def writeBack(self):
    '''
    Write back to any associated digest store the values of dirty (i.e. updated)
    element digests. If successfully written back then the digests should no
    longer be considered dirty.
    '''

class DigestStoreBase(metaclass=ABCMeta):
  '''
  Digest stores are intended to store digests of elements' associated
  resources to, usually, persistent storage. They allow single digests to be
  looked up by a key name - intended to be the str value of the element
  associated with the digest value and to update (or add) a set of new and
  changed element digest values.
  '''
  @abstractmethod
  def update(self, nameDigestPairs):
    '''
    The nameDigestPairs parameter should be a sequence of 
    (key name string, digest) pair sequences (e.g. tuples). It is intended
    that digest record for each key name is looked up in the store and if
    found replaced with the digest value of the (key name,digest) pair.
    Otherwise a new record is added to the store.
    '''
    pass
  @abstractmethod
  def retrieveDigest(self, recordName):
    '''
    The recordName parameter is intended to be a key name string, commonly a
    the str value of an assemblage element, for the required digest value to 
    retrieve and return. If not found a value convertible to False such as
    None should be returned
